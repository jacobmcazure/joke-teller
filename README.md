# Joke Teller
Author: Jacob McEwen
This application has an animated earth that tells jokes to the user using an interactive button. 

#### Description
This application is hosted on github pages. The user can ask the animation to tell it a joke from a database of hundreds of jokes. It communicates with 2 apis, one from
JokeAPI to retrieve a joke, which is converted into json format. The other is from VoiceRSS to perform text-to-speech conversion on the joke. 

###### Warning: these jokes are from the 'any' category, meaning there are no restrictions on the type of jokes told to the user.

#### Technologies used
* JS
* HTML
* CSS
* VoiceRSS
* JokeAPI (RESTful api)
